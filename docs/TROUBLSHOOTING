# TROUBLESHOOTING

## Symptom: RNDIS adapter exists but no ping responses
- Confirm correct USB port (DATA vs PWR)
- Confirm data-capable cable
- Confirm gadget mode config is correct
- Confirm device finished first boot (wait 2–5 minutes)

## Symptom: SSH reachable but password rejected / “valid user not set up”
Modern images may block SSH until a user is created during onboarding.
Solution: create user at first boot using the platform’s supported headless method
(e.g., `userconf.txt` with a hashed password for Raspberry Pi OS–based images).

## Symptom: Confusing subnet (192.168.137.x)
Windows ICS may force 192.168.137.1; many Pwnagotchi USB workflows commonly use 10.0.0.1/10.0.0.2.
Keep the repo documenting what you actually validated and stick to one scheme.
